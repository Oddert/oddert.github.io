<h1 class="text-center">Higher Design Assignment: Child’s Educational Toy</h1>

<h4 class="text-center">
  My final higher product design mark was comprised 50% by the design assignment, a directed design project to follow up the <a href=’/folios/folio_station_lighting.html’>design proposal. This folio achieved 100%, the first ever for Eastwood. </a>.
</h4>

<h5>
  The chosen brief for the design assignment was to create an educational toy for use in nurseries. The faux-company G&D, operates preschools aimed at providing educational environments to induce development in children 2 – 4 ½ years old.

  The four brief choices were to design: A toy, an outdoor play area, a seat or a [x], each had to incorporate an educational element. I choose the toy as I decided there was the greatest scope to incorporate an educational element.

<h5>
  For my six initial ideas I wanted to cover as many areas relating to child development as I could cover.
1)	Idea One (top left) uses machine learning through the open source Watson API to teach young kids how to interact with animals.
2)	Idea Two (top centre) is a series of modular blocks and components to move and interact with others to allow the creation of simple robotics to stimulate technical awareness.
3)	Idea Three (top right) allow the child to draw with non-permanent markers on a mat for a toy train to travel along.
4)	Idea Four (bottom left) is an assisted safety flying disc to allow for the development of basic physical activities.
5)	Idea Five (bottom centre) uses interactive motion tracking and a projector to allow the children to interact with computer programs.
6)	Idea Six (bottom right) Was a series of small toy characters, each representing an emotional state to facilitate discussion and awareness of emotion.

</div>

<h5>
  I choose to take forward the interactive toy dog and the assisted flying disk as these were the most unique with greatest potential for development.

  My final chosen design was the interactive dog, now developed to incorporate an interactive screen component (similar to idea five) and multiple modes of operation. My hope was that the dog could be used to simulate animal interactions with children who may be too young to be exposed to real animals in a nursery environment.

  Looking back, I was obviously proud of the first ever full marks for the course, the final design could feasibly have been mass-produced and could work. However, I do think more research was required and could have been expected for this project, I cannot help but think the reason the SQA liked it was purely because the development touched on all aspects of design but the final product was similar to others on the market already.
