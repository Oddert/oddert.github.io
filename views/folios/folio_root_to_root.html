<h1 class="text-center">The Root to Root Initiative</h1>

<h4 class="text-center">
  Root to Root is a piece of systems design which manifests towards the public as a supermarket campaign and aims to address some of the systemic underpinning of food waste.
</h4>

<h5>
  Almost half of all food produced for consumption is wasted in the west. This brief asked us to consider the problem from the perspective of behaviours and human-cantered design. With my project, I wanted to analyse the underlying systemic issues to see if the behaviours they produce could be subverted.

<h5>
  Root to Root, the name inspired from ‘Cradle to Cradle’, has three main consumer touch points aimed at closing the loop of food production and communicating an idea of circular economy in customers with the intention of driving not only change in individual behaviours but also attitudes towards waste in general.

  This is based on my research that found patterns of waste are often associated with structural aspects of the way modern life is organised, to name a few; lack of time leading to rushed shopping trips, the notion of the ‘weekly shop’ and need to have food stocked at home, large suburban areas dominated by automobiles, said areas being served by large chain supermarkets.

  All of which leads to: purchasing in bulk, impulse purchases, massive amounts of ‘efficient’ packaging, buying food to early, storing food for too long and so forth. Root to Root was specifically aimed at these suburban dwellers and the large chain superstores that are often their sole source of groceries.

<h5>
  Phase One, Retail: Fresh produce is now sold in the style of a farmers market, with minimal packaging, replaced with paper packaging and much of the foliage and roots left on. This is done for numerous reasons; to connect users to the ‘reality’ of food (away from intensive processing), to keep preservatives in the soil, reduce packaging waste for bullk-buyers, reduce food waste for people seeking small quantities and so forth.

  This also connects to the other components in that many fruit and vegetables can be revived long after they would be assumed useless by placing them in water or planting them, assuming enough foliage and roots are attached.

<h5>
  Phase two, Disposal: Customers without access to composting facilities can bring in their food waste which, leveraging the existing distribution networks to put the waste through a process of separate-source organics, composted and reused in the production process.

</div>

<h5>
  Phase three, Community engagement: A mini community market will be hosted in store where people can bring in sprouted vegetables or experimentations in horticulture and give them to someone who could make use.

  This is intended to build on the current trend for home food-growing and contribute to community building, creating a focal point much like a community noticeboard at the entrance to the shop.

<h5>
  Branding and communication plays an integral role in the Root to Root scheme, this leaflet is one of a range of materials produced to aid this, communicating the precedent and system in plain terms. On the reverse side is a mini poster detailing ideas for small-scale, indoor horticulture to incentivise users to take an interest.

  The second image is one of a series of simple posters, taking design cues from current advertising trends with large supermarkets. This particular poster introduces the community market by presenting a ‘useless’ vegetable and a use for it.
